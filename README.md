**TREND ESTIMATORS ML-PROJECT**

**Overview**

Our Machine Learning project analyses a house sale prices dataset, aiming to predict sale prices for properties
The project involves various computational tasks such as data loading, cleaning, visualisation, calculating returns, and portfolio analysis tailored to the real estate domain.

**Project Setup**

Each team member focused  on one model, gaining in-depth understanding of its workings, strengths, and limitations, and then shares their insights with the group. Thus, team members were able to work asynchronously, without dependencies or bottlenecks.

**Machine Learning Models**

The models were divided as such: XGBoost (Elham) XGBoost >$650K (Biruk), Linear Regression (Sara), KNN Regression (Scott).

**Deliverables**

* Jupyter Notebooks contains all the steps taken to clean the data, build models, and evaluate performance.
  
* In-class presentation summarising the machine learning process and key findings.

**Conclusion**

Upon comparing models, we found that XGBoost had the greatest predictive power.
